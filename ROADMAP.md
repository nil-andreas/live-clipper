# Project Roadmap

This document outlines immediate next steps for the project

---

## Immediate Goals

- **Detect moments**: Automatically detect interesting moments in during a livestream
- **Clip moments**: Automatically clip interesting moments of a stream and display in some way

---

## Future Ideas

- **Uploading to streaming platform**: Additionally, uploading the interesting clips to Youtube or some other platform
- **Integrate AI**: Use LLMs to classify an interesting moment

---

## Completed

- **Score a chat log using different scoring algorithms**
- **Display a streaming graph of the chat being scored**
- **Integrate with a live twitch chat**
- **Option to clip interesting moments in a stream**

---

## Discarded ideas

- **Pause/Reverse/Play/Live options for the streaming graph**: It is only possible to clip the stream in realtime.
  Navigating through time in the graph does no longer seem interesting.
