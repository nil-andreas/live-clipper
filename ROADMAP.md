# Project Roadmap

This document outlines immediate next steps for the project

---

## Immediate Goals

- **Admin page for clips**: Search/Watch/Remove recorded clips
- **Admin page for subscriptions**: Add/List/Remove current subscribed channels
- **Adaptive scoring**: The algorithm to determine if a clip is interesting should handle a general increase in score.
  And not start to constantly clip when that happens
- **Name project**: The project deserves a name (top candidate is LiveClipper, for now)
---

## Future Ideas

- **Uploading to streaming platform**: Additionally, uploading the interesting clips to Youtube or some other platform
- **Integrate AI**: Use LLMs to classify an interesting moment

---

## Completed

- **Score a chat log using different scoring algorithms**
- **Display a streaming graph of the chat being scored**
- **Integrate with a live twitch chat**
- **Option to clip interesting moments in a stream**
- **Automatically detect interesting moments during a livestream**
- **Automatically clip interesting moments of a stream and display in some way**
- **View clips without logging in to twitch**

---

## Discarded ideas

- **Pause/Reverse/Play/Live options for the streaming graph**: It is only possible to clip the stream in realtime.
  Navigating through time in the graph does no longer seem interesting.
